__ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m GUIJIN SON.__   
---   
Greetings! My name is Guijin Son, and I am an undergraduate student at Yonsei University.

My academic and research interests span a broad spectrum; however, my recent focus has been dedicated to exploring the intricacies of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite the extensive resources allocated for training LLMs, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. In light of this, my recent research includes (1) analyzing the behavior of LLMs ([Multi-Task Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11597)) and (2) investigating their performance across non-English languages (especially Korean) ([HAE-RAE Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02706), [KMMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11548)).

At the moment, I am actively seeking new research opportunities! Please feel free to reach out :)
